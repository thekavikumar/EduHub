# Welcome to EduHub

Hey there 👋! Welcome to Eduhub. The one stop to satisfy your curiosity.
If you wish to use the app, feel free to click the hosted link, or if you wish to test it yourself you can clone the github repo and have fun! ![link](https://eduhub-thekavikumar.vercel.app/)

# Inspiration

The inspiration we had for building this app was drawn from few others like Medium and Fuzia. But the problem with such websites is that everything is available to the public eye and you cannot create a private space consisting of only authorised members.
We aim to solve this issue with our solution Eduhub.

## Why EduHub?

## Authentication

Eduhub uses an authentication service to those with valid addresses and can form groups on an instance. These instances can be used by groups of individuals to create a common sharing forum where contributions can be done with texts, images and reference links.

## Like system

All the posts have a like system where users part of that group can like the image and this helps promote the content that is supported by most.

## Article display

Each content card when clicked opens to an interactive reading page, that has easy-to-read fonts and pleasant backgrounds for tireless learning. We also can display images on the cards that are relevant to the topic.

## Sharing system

Sometimes, certain posts may be worth sharing outside, hence we have provided a sharing feature that provides the link of the reference or the post which can be copied and shared.

## Comment section

The comment section allows multiple users to partake in discussions without them knowing each other personally. This can make for great discussions if used constructively and all the users will be able to share immediate feedback through these comments

## Search bar

Searching for a particular post becomes very easy.
There is less time wasted on searching

# Challenges faced during development

🚩 The authorization of emails and assigning each of them a new user in the app was a milestone in our journey. Creating a like system was something we heavily underestimated and took a lot of time and brainpower to resolve.

🚩 Creating a working comment section proved to be too hard and we weren't able to fully implement it in time.

🚩 Lack of quality resources online made it very difficult to resolve certain rare errors as proposed solutions were on a whole different concept and those solutions ggave more problems.

🚩 Provision of proper API routes was irritating as certain requests that used the same routes did not allow the code to function as intended

🚩 Getting the search bar to provide accurate results was challenging as multiple searching fields needed to be included

# Accomplishments we are proud of 🥳

⭐ Implementing a successful authentication system was an unprecedented accomplishment for us as providing unique usernames along with google validation was very challenging

⭐ Building this application in a short period of time was pretty difficult, as certain features could not be implemented in time, but we are proud of how the app has turned out so far and we wish to see it through to completion.

# Future's Features

🚀 Post the completion of sharing and comment section, we plan to create a facility for private chat rooms with users added via email where there can be a group admin who regulates entry, exit and posts.
🚀 We also would like to include some sort of analytic metric to boost posts with more likes and boost accounts with better reputation to incentivize good behavior
